    Calculate deductible gas fees for applicable transactions.


1. create a new github repo for this project
2. set the remote origin to the new repo
3. README - update to reflect the project
4. project - chat example
    1. update the project so '/' root project is the code from 'examples/chat'
5. Delete unused directories and files. Do not delete instructions.md
    1. /cdp-agentkit-core
    2. /cdp-langchain
    3. /cdp-langchain-chatbot-example
    4. /chatbot
6. Generate instructions - find where autonomous agent instructions are defined
    1. Located in chatbot.ts in the messageHandler parameter of the createChatbot function
    2. current isstructions focus on general CDP agentkit interactions
    3. Next step would be to customize these instructions for tax efficient tasking
